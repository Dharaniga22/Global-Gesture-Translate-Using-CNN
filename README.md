# Global-Gesture-Translate-Using-CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on improving communication for the deaf and mute community by developing an advanced hand gesture recognition and translation system. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system identifies hand gestures and translates them into multiple languages, offering customizable language options and accessibility features such as text-to-speech.

## Features
* **Accurate Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes CNNs to extract meaningful features from hand gesture videos or images for accurate interpretation.
* **Multilingual Translation:** Converts recognized gestures into multiple languages, ensuring wide accessibility and user adaptability.
* **Customizable Language Preferences:** Users can select their preferred language for translations, enhancing user experience.
* **Accessibility Features:** Incorporates text-to-speech functionality to assist users with hearing or visual impairments.
* **Contextual Analysis:** Uses GNNs to understand relationships between gestures, enabling sophisticated interpretation.

## System Architecture
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** The system uses pre-trained CNN models to extract key features from hand movements.
- **Gesture-Contextual Mapping:** GNNs analyze the relationships between gestures to enhance the system's understanding of complex movements.
- **Multilingual Translation:** The extracted features are mapped to language-based representations, enabling real-time gesture translation across various languages.
- **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive and accessible interface with language customization and text-to-speech options.

## Installation
